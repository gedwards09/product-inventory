# Inventory Manager Desktop App

This is an Inventory Magangement Application built in Java for tracking items added to an inventory through a desktop GUI built using JavaFX.

Each item has a name which must be unique within the inventory, and its weight, wholesale price, and quantity in stock must be specied when adding it to inventory. Storage costs are based on weight at a storage rate of $4.00 per pound, and retail price is calculated based on an 85% markup of wholesale price plus storage costs for the item.

Items can be viewed, edited, or removed while in inventory, and an inventory report tracks the number of different products, total quantity, wholesale costs, and retail value of the inventory as a whole.

Inventory can be imported from and exported to csv file to save inventory contents for later use.
